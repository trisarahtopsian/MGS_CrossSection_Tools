# MGS Quaternary Cross Section Tools

This repository contains ArcGIS toolboxes of Python 3 geoprocessing tools for setting up cross section data, editing, and checking for data quality. The data are set up in a "stacked" display, which allows the user to view all east-west cross sections without the use of data-driven pages or map series. The stacked display uses mapview X coordinates for the horizontal dimension. The display only works for precisely east-west cross sections, and will not work for zig-zag or diagonal cross section lines.

Some documentation, sample data, and layer files for the tools can be found in this repository. It is currently under construction.
