# MGS Cross Section Tools

This repository contains ArcGIS toolboxes of Python 3 geoprocessing tools for setting up cross section data, editing, and checking for data quality. Most tools will output data in either the "stacked" or "traditional" display. In general at the MGS, quaternary cross sections will use the "stacked" display, and bedrock cross sections will use the "traditional" display. 

There are two toolbox files: `MGS_CrossSection_Tools.atbx` and `MGS_QStrat_Editing_and_QC.atbx`. The first toolbox contains all cross section tools, and the second contains tools that are used during cross section data creation. The second toolbox was created to reduce clutter for mapping geologists so they only see the tools that they need to use. The first toolbox also contains tools to convert data between the "stacked" and "traditional" cross section displays.

Some documentation, sample data, and layer files for the tools can be found in this repository. All scripts and associated files are currently under construction.
